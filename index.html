        Of youth as a High School Sophomore, I'm seeking out job opportunity to power America's great future.
        Coding is a useful of mine where I specialize in Hyper Text Markup Languge (HTML) for website deveolpment.

        biking, swimming, and even running.

        I grew up in many different educational enviroments through my grade levels in clubs, and other outside school
        groups.
        These enviroments have exposed me to people who I've built a knack for aiding, that still presists today.

        My grades of all A's and B's has lead to a showing of being able to keep up with myself as well during these

        I cannot wait to graduate High School in my projected year of 2020 furthermore with my cumulative 4.0 GPA to
        further my career in the business world.

      Starting just recently, I've been helping out businesses with volunteering.
      My first of many major commitment has been with the Arizona Interscholastic Cycling Association where I helped
      with setting up race equipment before continuing my efforts with contributations towards racing registrations.

    </div>

    <div class="text">

      In the digital world however, I've gone on to create multiple website, most of which entirely from scratch with
      only my own to be responsible for the end products, such as this one.
      Having a likeness in video games alongside my experience in Coding has also lead me to create many passion
      projects in High School that relate to Game design as well.

    <div class="text">

      All these efforts and many more lead a vast amount of potenital for what I see myself capable accomplishing for
      even bigger causes with my dire to forge bigger contributations to society, and my personal resume which may be
      viewed here, should showcase this:

        Naturally, my talent for web design has brought me excellent motor skills with HTML5 and CSS3 programs.
        I also must put my version control skills to the test in the process as well to manage all of my works
        effectivily between multiple working stations.

      <div class="text">

        Systems can be the name of my game as well because of my long history in computer usage stemming even from my
        most impacting childhood days of deep learning.
        That wide array of knowledge of computers has even left me among my many friends and even teachers as the first
        requested source for technical support, where I show great competence.

      </div>

      <div class="text">

        Skills even delveloping further into areas such as technical writing and the future of my Javascript knowledge
        should show how much I'm capable of covering in the technical department.
