      <div class="text">

        Of youth as a High School Sophomore, I'm seeking out job opportunity to power America's great future.
        Coding is a versatile talent of mine where I specialize in Hyper Text Markup Languge (HTML) for website
        deveolpment.
        I have passions for other activities such as competing in gaming tournaments, but also enjoy the outdoors with
        biking, swimming, and even running.

        I grew up in many different educational environments through my grade levels in clubs, and other outside school
        groups.
        These environments have exposed me to people who I've built a knack for aiding, that still persists today.

      </div>

      <div class="text">

        My grades of all A's and B's have been a showing of how I'm able to keep up with myself as well during these
        years of assigned worked.
        Once I graduate High School in my projected year of 2020 with my cumulative 4.0 GPA, I desire to further my
        career in the business world.

    <div class="text">

      Starting recently, I've been helping out businesses with volunteering.
      My first of many major commitment has been with the Arizona Interscholastic Cycling Association where I helped
      with setting up race equipment before continuing my efforts with contribution towards racing registrations.

    </div>

    <div class="text">

      In the digital world however, I've gone on to create multiple website, most of which entirely from scratch with
      only my own responsible for the end products, such as this one.
      Having a likeness in video games along my experience in Coding has also lead me to create many passion projects
      in High School that relate to Game design as well.

    <div class="text">

      All these efforts and many more lead a vast amount of potenital for what I see myself capable accomplishing for
      even bigger causes with my dire to forge bigger contributations to society
      And my personal resume, which may be viewed here, should showcase this:

      <!-- The link to my resume is put in here as a direct link to said Google Drive. I also put it in
      a sperate div class and give it a class of "special" so I can make it futher stand out. -->

      <div class="text">

        Naturally, my talent for web design has brought me excellent motor skills with HTML5 and CSS3 programs.
        I also must put my version control skills to the test in the process as well to manage all of my works
        effectively between multiple working stations.

      </div>

      <div class="text">

        Systems can also be the name of my game as well because of my long history in computer usage stemming even from
        my most impacting childhood days of deep learning.
        That wide array of knowledge of computers has even left me among my many friends and even teachers as the first
        requested source for technical support, where I show great competence.

      </div>

      <div class="text">

        My skills developing even further into areas such as technical writing and the future of my Javascript
        knowledge should show how much I'm capable of covering in the technical department.
